# Exploit Labs
> Collection of Dockerized labs with examples of various exploits
>
**DISCLAIMER**: These labs are intended for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. The goal of these labs is to break down and understand these exploits in a safe and controlled enviroment.
I do not condone any real world implemention of any exploits.
